                <div className="description_about">I am a freelance illustrator based in <b>Hyderabad,India</b>. Professionally, Iâ€™m a <b>software engineer</b>, but at heartâ€”Iâ€™m an artist. 
                    <br></br>I think I started drawing even before I learned the ABCs. My mom tells me I used to scribble circles on every piece of paper I could find around the houseâ€”those were probably my first-ever drawings ðŸ˜Š.<br></br> Art runs in the familyâ€”my dad is a self-taught artist and a constant source of inspiration. 
                    While academics took over for a while, the pandemic gave me the chance to reconnect with my creative side, and since then, art has been an inseparable part of my life again. Iâ€™m also a hobby writer and enjoy expressing myself through both words and visuals.
                    Through this platform, Iâ€™ll be sharing all my recent artworkâ€”from personal projects to commissioned pieces.I take orders for <b>custom portraits</b> and artwork for <b>birthdays</b>,<b>weddings</b>, <b>housewarmings</b>, and any other special events. For collaborations, commissions, or any queries, feel free to reach out:  ðŸ“© motamarrianusha01@gmail.com.
