            <div className="description_about">I am a freelance illustrator based in Hyderabad,India. I am a software engineer by profession. But by heart, I am an artist. 
                I am a hobby writer too.
                I think I started drawing before even I knew ABCD. My mom tells me that I used to keep drawing circles on every piece of paper I found in the house. Yeah, Those were the first drawings I ever made ðŸ˜‰
                 . My father is a self-taught artist by hobby. He is a constant inspiration to me. 
                 For a long time, I left art aside because of academic pressure. But during the pandemic, I revived my hobbies and art is one of them.
                I accept commssioned portraits, artworks for birthdays, weddings, housewarming, or for any other events.
               This platform is a place where I will be posting all my artworks. For further information and any kind of queries or concerns contact <b>motamarrianusha01@gmail.com</b>.
